I'm a third year graduate student from ZheJiang University. My research interest includes computer vision, autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Rong Xiong and Prof. Yue Wang from the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University. I have won the National Scholarship for undergraduates in 2019, 2020, and 2021, and the National Scholarship for postgraduates in 2024.
